// Central claim:
[Legalisation of Soft Drugs]: Soft drugs should be legal. 
    + <No harm, no ban>: The role of legislation is to 
    protect society from harm, but not to protect people 
    from themselves. We do not legislate against fatty 
    foods or lack of exercise, both of which have serious 
    health implications. The individual's freedom is 
    paramount unless serious harm is done by particular 
    act. Taking soft drugs does not harm anybody else and 
    has only minimal negative effects on the person taking 
    them -- it is a 'victcimless crime'. As such, it should 
    not be a crime at all. #pro 
    - <Law must protect>: It is right that governments 
    should legislate in a way that overrides personal 
    freedom to protect people from themselves as well as 
    from each other. That is why bare-knuckle boxing is 
    banned and seatbelts are compulsory in some countries 
    (e.g. Britain). These are ways in which personal 
    freedom is overridden by legislation designed to 
    protect personal safety. #con 
        + <Soft drugs are harmful>: Soft drugs are harmful: 
        cannabis smoke (as well as the tobacco with which 
        it is often mixed) is carcinogenic, and prolonged 
        cannabis smoking has been shown to cause brain 
        damage and significant loss of motivation and 
        short-term memory. Amphetamines interfere with the 
        nervous system in a potentially damaging way. 
        Drug-takers also put others at risk by taking 
        mind-altering substances that can lead to 
        unpredictable and dangerous behaviour. #con 
            -> <No harm, no ban>
    + <Lifestyle decision>: Individuals should be left to 
    choose their own lifestyle and priorities. If that 
    includes using drugs for pleasure and relaxation then 
    that is a perfectly valid decision. #pro 
        - <Moral leadership>: The government should provide 
        moral leadership as well as legislating to protect 
        the health of the individual and the safety of 
        others. The drug-using lifestyle is a shallow, 
        hedonistic, apathetic, inward-looking, uncreative 
        form of escapism. Governments should legislate and 
        speak out against drugs to discourage young people 
        from this lifestyle and encourage them to engage in 
        healthier and more creative pastimes. #con   
    + <Alcohol and tobacco analogy>: The law is currently 
    inconsistent. Cannabis and speed have comparable 
    physical and mental effects to those of alcohol and 
    tobacco, which are legal drugs. If anything, alcohol 
    and tobacco have more seriously damaging effects. If 
    alcohol and tobacco are legal then soft drugs should be 
    too. #pro 
        + <Tobacco and alcohol more dangerous>: 
        Tobacco-related diseases kill millions each year, 
        and alcohol is responsible for deaths on the road, 
        civil disorder and domestic violence on a huge 
        scale. Cannabis and speed make people 'spaced out' 
        or hyperactive respectively for short periods in 
        social situations and are relatively harmless. #pro  
        - <Major differences>: The effects of soft drugs 
        may be 'comparable' with those of alcohol and 
        tobacco but there are important differences. 
        Cannabis and speed are mindaltering in a 
        way that alcohol and tobacco are not. #con 
        <_ <Poor reason>: In any case, the fact that 
        harmful and dangerous substances (tobacco and 
        alcohol) are already, regrettably, socially 
        entrenched is not a good reason to allow two more 
        such substances to become more widely used and 
        socially acceptable. #con // undercuts the analogy
    + <Listen to society>: Speed and cannabis are widely 
    used, not just by stereotypical 'drug users', but by a 
    large minority of middle class and professional people. 
    The current law makes criminals of many otherwise 
    respectable' citizens. The government should listen to 
    society. #pro 
    - <Minimize destructive activity>: Our aim is to 
    minimise drug use since it is a destructive, dangerous 
    and anti-social activity. Legalising soft drugs will 
    inevitably mean that there is an increase in drug use. 
    Therefore, we should not legalise soft drugs, even if 
    an alarming number of people already use them. #con 
        + <Soft drugs are harmful>
    - <Argument from addiction>:  We should be concerned 
    about any addictive substance. While it would be 
    impractical to ban many psychologically addictive 
    things (like coffee or shopping), in the case of soft 
    drugs they are already banned and there is no reason to 
    reverse that situation. #con 
        + <Soft drugs are addictive>: It is hard to draw an 
        exact line between physical and psychological 
        addiction - they are two sides of the same coin. 
        Recent research has demonstrated that cannabis is 
        highly addictive - in the US in particular, many 
        self-help groups for cannabis addicts have recently 
        been formed,with rapidly growing membership. 
        Whether we call that addiction 'psychological' or 
        'physical' is immaterial. #con 
        <_ <Addiction no reason to ban>: Soft drugs are not 
        physically addictive and even if they were that 
        would not be a reason for them to be illegal -- 
        caffeine, alcohol and nicotine are physically 
        addictive and still legal. And being 
        psychologically addictive is even less of a reason 
        to ban something. Manythings, such as shopping, sex,
        jogging or gambling may be psychologically 
        addictive, and many people are inately susceptible 
        to psychological addiction. We cannot ban all 
        things that a minority might come to depend upon -- 
        we should instead provide counselling for addicts. 
        #pro // undercuts the @<Argument from addiction>
    - <Slippery slope>: Soft drugs are dangerous because 
    they start people down the 'slippery slope' to using 
    ever-harder drugs. The same dealer will try to push 
    harder drugs onto his clients who use soft drugs, by 
    cutting cannabis or speed with cocaine or heroin or 
    offering free samples to get them hooked. Legalisation 
    of soft drugs would, ironically, provide a whole market 
    for hard drug pushers, who would be able to undercut 
    the prices of duty-inflated market goods. #con 
        - <Coffee houses>: Legalising soft drugs, and 
        allowing them to  be sold in licensed premises, 
        perhaps like the 'coffee houses' in Amsterdam that 
        sell cannabis, will separate them from the criminal 
        underworld associated with drug dealing. The 
        'slippery slope' would then no longer exist. People 
        could purchase soft drugs without having to come 
        into contact with dealers who might cut their drugs 
        with harder drugs or try to get them onto harder 
        drugs in other ways. (In any case, only a tiny 
        minority of cannabis users ever go on to use harder 
        drugs.) #pro 
    + <Tax revenue>: Finally, the government could use the 
    sale of soft drugs as a source of revenue through 
    excise duty, as is already done with alcohol and 
    tobacco. #pro
