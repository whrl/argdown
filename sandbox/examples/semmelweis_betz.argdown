# Three Rival Hypotheses

/* Semmelweis and his colleagues considered three 
explanations for the outbreak of so-called childbed fever 
in their Vienna hospital: */

[Epidemic Influence Hypothesis]: The outbreak of childbed 
fever is controlled by epidemic influences. #H1 

[Rough Examination Hypothesis]: The outbreak of childbed 
fever is controlled by injuries that stem from incompetent 
examinations. #H2 

[Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]: The outbreak of childbed 
fever is controlled by the degree of contamination with 
cadavric substance. #H3 

/* The explanations were understood to be rivals: */

[Epidemic Influence Hypothesis]
  -> [Rough Examination Hypothesis]     // H1 and H2 are contrary
  -> [Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]    // H1 amd H3 are contrary

[Rough Examination Hypothesis]
  -> [Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]    // H2 and H3 are contrary


# Evidence

/* The following items of evidence were considered to be 
relevant for deciding which of the three hypotheses is 
correct. */

[Difference Between Divisions]: By default, more women 
contract childbed fever in the First than in the Second 
Division of the hospital.

[Washing Helps]: If the students who examine the women in 
the First Division disinfect their hands, the ratio of 
women contracting childbed fever is the same in both 
divisions.

[Death of Kolletschka]: A colleague of Semmelweis suffered 
from symptoms similar to childbed fever and eventually died.

[Birth at Home]: The mortality of women who give birth at 
home or on their way to the hospital is significantly lower 
than in the First Division.

[No Variations]: Cases of childbed fever and corresponding 
mortality rates do not display spatio-temporal variations 
(e.g. seasonal, or from district to district) that are 
characteristic for epidemic diseases.


# Arguments and Further Theses {isGroup: false}

/* The arguments reconstructed in this section detail 
whether the three hypotheses can explain or whether they 
conflict with the available evidence. Arguments are tagged 
according to whether the lay out explanatory relations or 
conflicts of hypothesis H1, H2, and H3. In addition to 
these arguments, the section makes further auxiliary 
assumptions explicit. */


## Inferential Relations between 
@[Epidemic Influence Hypothesis] and the 
Available Evidence {isGroup: false}

/* Relying on a crucial auxiliary assumption, H1 can 
explain various pieces of evidence. Yet it conflicts with 
observation @[No Variations]. */

[Difference in Exposure]: Women in the First Division are 
exposed to epidemic diseases more heavily than those who 
give birth at home, on their way to the hospital, or in the 
Second Division. #H1 #aux 


<Epidemic Exposition 1>: Women in the First Division are 
exposed to epidemic diseases more heavily than those in the 
Second Divison. #H1 

  (1) [Epidemic Influence Hypothesis]
  (2) [Difference in Exposure]
  (3) If childbed fever is controlled by infections and 
  women of one group are more frequently infected than 
  those in another group, than members of the first group 
  will catch childbed fever more frequently.
  ----
  (4) [Difference Between Divisions]


<Epidemic Exposition 2>: Women in the First Division are 
exposed to epidemic diseases more heavily than those who 
give birth at home or on their way to the hospital. #H1 

  (1) [Epidemic Influence Hypothesis]
  (2) [Difference in Exposure]
  (3) If childbed fever is controlled by infections and 
  women of one group are more frequently infected than 
  those in another group, than members of the first group 
  will catch childbed fever more frequently.
  ----
  (4) [Birth at Home]


<Epidemic Variations>: If caused by epidemic diseases, 
childbed fever would show characteristic variations. #H1 

  (1) [Epidemic Influence Hypothesis]
  (2) If childbed fever is controlled by infections, then 
  it displays spatio-temporal variations (e.g. seasonal, or 
  from district to district) that are characteristic for 
  epidemic diseases.
  ----
  (3) Cases of childbed fever and corresponding mortality 
  rates display spatio-temporal variations (e.g. seasonal, 
  or from district to district) that are characteristic for 
  epidemic diseases.
    -> [No Variations]


## Inferential Relations between 
@[Rough Examination Hypothesis] and 
the Available Evidence {isGroup: false}

/* Hypothesis H2 provides an explanation of a single 
evidence item; however, the explanation builds on highly 
contest assumptions (as the attacks on the premises make 
explicit). */

<Inexperienced Medical Students>: Women in the First 
Division are examined by medical students who, because of 
their inexperience, cause more injuries due to rough 
examinations than midwives. #H2 

  (1) [Rough Examination Hypothesis]
  (2) [Medical Students vs Midwives]: Women in the First 
  Division are examined by medical students, women in the 
  Second Division by midwives.
  (3) [More Injuries]: Due to their inexperience, medical 
  students cause more injuries during examination than 
  midwives. #H2 
  (4) If childbed fever is caused by injuries and women in 
  one group are examined by persons who inflict more 
  injuries than those persons which examine women in 
  another group, then members of the former group will 
  suffer from childbed fever more frequently.
    - [Examination Injuries Insignificant]: Difference in 
    examination doesn't entail difference in childbed fever.
  ----
  (5) [Difference Between Divisions]


<Medical Students Skillfull>: Medical students are no less 
skillfull than midwives and carry out the examinations in 
approximately the same way.

  (1) Medical students are no less skillfull than midwives 
  and carry out the examinations in approximately the same 
  way.
  (2) If medical students are no less skillfull than 
  midwives and carry out the examinations in approximately 
  the same way, then they cause no more injuries during 
  examination than midwives.
  ----
  (3) Medical students don't cause more injuries during 
  examination than midwives.
    >< [More Injuries]


<Main Injuries due to Birth>: The main injuries that women 
suffer are due to giving birth itself and not to previous 
or posterior examinations.

  (1) The main injuries that women suffer are due to giving 
  birth itself and not to previous or posterior 
  examinations.
  (2) If injuries that stem from examinations are much less 
  severe than the injuries which stem from giving birth 
  itself, all women that give birth, no matter whether they 
  have been examined roughly or not, will suffer from the 
  same degree of injuries.
  (3) If all women who give birth, no matter whether they 
  have been examined roughly or not, will suffer from the 
  same degree of injuries, then difference in examination 
  doesn't entail difference in childbed fever (i.e., it is 
  not the case that, provided childbed fever is caused by 
  injuries and women in one group are examined by persons 
  who inflict more injuries than those persons which 
  examine women in another group, members of the former 
  group will suffer from childbed fever more frequently).

  (4) [Examination Injuries Insignificant]


## Inferential Relations between 
@[Cadavric Substance Hypothesis] and 
the Available Evidence {isGroup: false}

/* Hypothesis H3 accounts for four of the five evidence 
items; it doesn't contradict any observation. @[Cadavric 
Substance Hypothesis] is therefore by far the best 
explanation for the available evidence. */

<Medical Students Contaminate 1>: Medical students, who 
carry out examinations in the First but not in the Second 
Division, contaminate the women with cadavric substance. 
#H3 

  (1) [Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]
  (2) [Medical Students vs Midwives]: Women in the First 
  Division are examined by medical students, women in the 
  Second Division by midwives.
  (3) Medical students are, by default and unlike midwives, 
  stained with cadavric substance and contamine the persons 
  they examine.
  (4) If childbed fever is caused by contamination with 
  cadavric substance and if women in one group are 
  contaminated to a higher degree than women in another 
  group, then members of the former group will suffer from 
  childbed fever more frequently.
  ----
  (5) [Difference Between Divisions]


<Medical Students Contaminate 2>: Medical students, who 
carry out examinations, contaminate the women in the First 
Division with cadavric substance, yet not those who give 
birth at home. #H3 

  (1) [Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]
  (2) Women in the First Division are examined by medical 
  students, women who give birth at home or on their way to 
  the hospital not.
  (3) Medical students are, by default, stained with 
  cadavric substance and contaminate the persons they 
  examine.
  (4) If childbed fever is caused by contamination with 
  cadavric substance and if women in one group are 
  contaminated to a higher degree than women in another 
  group, then members of the former group will suffer from 
  childbed fever more frequently.
  ----
  (5) [Birth at Home]


<Washing Blocks Contamination>: Disinfecting, by preventing 
contamination with cadavric substance, reduces the ratio of 
women who suffer from childbed fever. #H3 

  (1) [Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]
  (2) If the students who examine the women in the First 
  Division disinfect their hands, they reduce the extent to 
  which they are stained with cadavric substance.
  (3) If the students who examine the women in the First 
  Division reduce the extent to which they are stained with 
  cadavric substance, and if childbed fever is caused by 
  contamination with cadavric substance, then fewer persons 
  examined by the students will suffer from childbed fever.
  ----
  (4) [Washing Helps]


<Kolletschka Contaminated>: Kolletschka was slightly 
wounded during an autopsy and infected with cadavric 
substance. #H3 

  (1) [Cadavric Substance Hypothesis]
  (2) Kolletschka was slightly wounded during an autopsy, 
  and infected with cadavric substance.
  (3) If childbed fever is caused by contamination with 
  cadavric substance and if a person is contaminated with 
  cadavric substance, then the person will show symptoms 
  similar to childbed fever (and eventually die).
